- Network traffic analysis (tcpdump/Wireshark)
- SIEM fundamentals (Wazuh) and detection-to-investigation workflows
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for investigation context

## Current project
- **WardScry (in progress):** Linux honeytoken detection tool designed to surface suspicious file access with user/time/host context and generate SIEM-friendly alerts.

## Labs & write-ups
